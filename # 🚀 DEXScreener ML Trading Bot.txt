# üöÄ DEXScreener ML Trading Bot ‚Äî **Detailed Roadmap for Codex**

---

## **1. Project Initialization & Setup**

**1.1.** Ensure all dependencies from `requirements.txt` are installed.

**1.2.** Create a project folder structure:

```
/DEX Bot
    /data
    /scripts
    /models
    /logs
    requirements.txt
    config.env (store API keys, secrets here‚Äînever upload to GitHub)
```

**1.3.** Load and test all API keys (Dexscreener, Moralis, Pump.fun SDK) to confirm connectivity.

---

## **2. Data Collection Pipeline**

**2.1.** Build scripts to fetch real-time Solana coin data:

* Token address, name, price, volume, liquidity, age, creator address, etc.
* Use Dexscreener, Moralis, Pump.fun.

**2.2.** Store the fetched data as rows in `/data/coin_data.csv`.

* Include timestamp for every record.

**2.3.** Schedule the script to fetch and append data every 5‚Äì10 minutes (use Windows Task Scheduler or a simple Python `while True` loop + `time.sleep`).

**2.4.** Log all API requests and errors to `/logs/data_collection.log`.

---

## **3. Data Preparation & Feature Engineering**

**3.1.** Build a script to:

* Load the latest `/data/coin_data.csv`.
* Clean data (handle missing/duplicate rows).
* Calculate useful features for ML (e.g., price change %, 1h/24h trend, liquidity delta, market cap, holders count).

**3.2.** Save the processed data as `/data/features.csv` for use in ML.

---

## **4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization** *(Optional but recommended)*

**4.1.** Build simple plots:

* Price vs time
* Volume vs time
* Distribution of gains/losses

**4.2.** Analyze which features seem useful for predicting a good coin.

---

## **5. Machine Learning Model Development**

**5.1.** Choose a starting ML framework (e.g., scikit-learn).

**5.2.** Start simple:

* Try a rules-based filter (e.g., coins with >X volume, \<Y age, >Z liquidity).
* Then move to logistic regression or decision trees.

**5.3.** Split data for training & testing (e.g., 80/20).

**5.4.** Train the model on `/data/features.csv` to output a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù or ‚Äúignore‚Äù signal.

**5.5.** Evaluate the model:

* Accuracy, precision, recall.
* Most importantly: **Simulate trades to see hypothetical profit/loss.**

---

## **6. Simulated (Paper) Trading Bot**

**6.1.** Build a script/class for paper trading:

* When ML says ‚Äúbuy,‚Äù log a fake buy (record price, timestamp, token, amount).
* When ML says ‚Äúsell,‚Äù log a fake sell.
* Keep a running virtual wallet balance.

**6.2.** Log all simulated trades and update a `/data/paper_trades.csv` with buy/sell events, amounts, and P\&L.

**6.3.** Review simulated results after hundreds/thousands of trades‚Äîiterate on your model if needed.

---

## **7. Real Trading Integration (Solana Network)**

**7.1.** Integrate the Solana SDK (solana-py or Pump.fun SDK).

**7.2.** Build functions to:

* Check your real wallet‚Äôs balance and recent activity.
* Place SPL token buy/sell orders programmatically.
* Only trade if all safety/risk checks are met (e.g., only small amounts, avoid flagged/rug tokens).

**7.3.** Log all real trades to `/logs/real_trades.log`.

---

## **8. Monitoring, Logging & Alerts**

**8.1.** Ensure all actions (data collection, trades, errors) are logged in `/logs/`.

**8.2.** (Optional but smart) Set up basic alerting:

* Email, Telegram, or Discord webhook for trade confirmations, major errors, or big wins/losses.

---

## **9. Automation & Deployment**

**9.1.** Script automation:

* Schedule scripts for regular runs (Windows Task Scheduler, cron, or `while True` loop).

**9.2.** Keep environment/config files separate and **never upload secrets to GitHub**.

**9.3.** Document each script, function, and setup step.

---

## **10. Continuous Improvement**

**10.1.** As more data is collected, retrain the ML model and compare results.

**10.2.** Add new features (e.g., social media sentiment, on-chain alerts).

**10.3.** Refine risk management:

* Stop-losses, max daily spend, blacklist obvious scams.

---

## **11. Documentation & Version Control**

**11.1.** Document all code (inline comments + README).

**11.2.** Use Git for version control; keep your repo clean (no data/logs/secrets).

**11.3.** Maintain a changelog for major project updates.

---

# **Summary Flow:**

1. **Collect data ‚Üí Prepare features ‚Üí Train ML model ‚Üí Paper trade ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Go live with real wallet.**

---

## **BONUS: Task List for Codex**

For each task, Codex should:

* Print a message when starting and finishing.
* Log all errors and warnings.
* Ask for confirmation before moving to real-money trading.

---

**Ready to proceed?**

* If yes:
  **Which part would you like a starter script for?**
  a) Data fetching
  b) Feature engineering
  c) Paper trading
  d) Simple ML model
  e) Real trading (Solana SDK)

Or want me to just start from the top (data fetching) and build step-by-step with you?
Your call!
